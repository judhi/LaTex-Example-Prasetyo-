abstract = {This book provides an introduction to Swarm Robotics, which is the application of methods from swarm intelligence to robotics. It goes on to present methods that allow readers to understand how to design large-scale robot systems by going through many example scenarios on topics such as aggregation, coordinated motion (flocking), task allocation, self-assembly, collective construction, and environmental monitoring. The author explains the methodology behind building multiple, simple robots and how the complexity emerges from the multiple interactions between these robots such that they are able to solve difficult tasks. The book can be used as a short textbook for specialized courses or as an introduction to Swarm Robotics for graduate students, researchers, and professionals who want a concise introduction to the field.}

                 in such collective decision making includes determining which 
                 individuals induce the decision and when. This experimental and 
                 theoretical study of shelter selection by cockroach groups 
                 demonstrates that choices can emerge through nonlinear interaction 
                 dynamics between equal individuals without perfect knowledge or 
                 leadership. We identify a simple mechanism whereby a decision is 
                 taken on the move with limited information and signaling and 
                 without comparison of available opportunities. This mechanism 
                 leads to optimal mean benefit for group individuals. Our model 
                 points to a generic self-organized collective decision-making 
                 process independent of animal species.},

  abstract ={Numerical models indicate that collective animal behavior may emerge from simple local rules of interaction among the individuals. However, very little is known about the nature of such interaction, so that models and theories mostly rely on aprioristic assumptions. By reconstructing the three-dimensional positions of individual birds in airborne flocks of a few thousand members, we show that the interaction does not depend on the metric distance, as most current models and theories assume, but rather on the topological distance. In fact, we discovered that each bird interacts on average with a fixed number of neighbors (six to seven), rather than with all neighbors within a fixed metric distance. We argue that a topological interaction is indispensable to maintain a flock's cohesion against the large density changes caused by external perturbations, typically predation. We support this hypothesis by numerical simulations, showing that a topological interaction grants significantly higher cohesion of the aggregation compared with a standard metric one.},

  abstract = {The behavior of Markov chains depends on the
              transition intensities or probabilities; in
              applications, these transitions are often
              written as functions of parameters. In this
              paper, matrix calculus is used to provide the
              sensitivities and elasticities of the behavior
              of continuous time-absorbing Markov chains to
              arbitrary parameters, which could include the
              transition intensities themselves or parameters
              in which those intensities depend. The results
              include the sensitivity and elasticity of the
              moments, variances, standard deviations, and
              coefficients of variation of the time spent in
              transient states and the time to absorption.
              The number of visits to transient states is
              also analyzed, using the embedded discrete-time
              chain. For models with multiple absorbing
              states, the sensitivity of the probability of
              absorption in each absorbing state is
              presented. As an example, a published model for
              the progress of colorectal cancer is analyzed
              in detail. Transient states in this model are
              defined by disease status, and the model
              includes two absorbing states: death from
              cancer and death from other causes. The
              perturbation analysis provides a quantitative
              comparison of the effect of changing transition
              and mortality rates. Such information may be
              useful for evaluating treatment or screening
              programs. Copyright © 2011 John Wiley & Sons,

                 result of conflict is the invasion by one of the
                 species of territory held by the other. A simple
                 stochastic model for this process is described and
                 rules are given for the calculation, as a function of
                 time, of the probabilities that individual territories
                 and groups of territories are held by a single
                 species. Asymptotic results are given for the pattern
                 of territories held by a single species, and here a
                 remarkable distinction is seen between the cases of
                 one-dimensional and two-dimensional competition and
                 the case of three-dimensional competition. The process
                 of invasion is contrasted with two relatively benign
                 processes, that in which an exchange of territories is
                 arranged and that in which a spatial alternation of
                 species may be beneficial to the community. The
                 implications of the long-term behaviour of such
                 processes are discussed. It is suggested further that,
                 under certain ideal conditions, it may be possible to
                 estimate the duration of a spatial struggle for life
                 by observing at some time the configuration of

We might be less aware of it, but group decisions are just as important to social animals as they are for us. Animal groups have to collectively decide about communal movements, activities, nesting sites and enterprises, such as cooperative breeding or hunting, that crucially affect their survival and reproduction. While human group decisions have been studied for millennia, the study of animal group decisions is relatively young, but is now expanding rapidly. It emerges that group decisions in animals pose many similar questions to those in humans. The purpose of the present issue is to integrate and combine approaches in the social and natural sciences in an area in which theoretical challenges and research questions are often similar, and to introduce each discipline to the other{\textquoteright}s key ideas, findings and successful methods. In order to make such an introduction as effective as possible, here, we briefly review conceptual similarities and differences between the sciences, and provide a guide to the present issue.},

                 manipulation by a strongly
                 opinionated, or extremist, minority. It has

                 micro-organisms and cells is of great relevance in the 
                 fields of biology, ecology and medicine. Movement models 
                 can take many different forms, but the most widely used 
                 are based on the extensions of simple random walk processes. 
                 In this review paper, our aim is twofold: to introduce the 
                 mathematics behind random walks in a straightforward manner 
                 and to explain how such models can be used to aid our 
                 understanding of biological processes. We introduce the 
                 mathematical theory behind the simple random walk and explain 
                 how this relates to Brownian motion and diffusive processes 
                 in general. We demonstrate how these simple models can be 
                 extended to include drift and waiting times or be used to 
                 calculate first passage times. We discuss biased random walks 
                 and show how hyperbolic models can be used to generate correlated 
                 random walks. We cover two main applications of the random walk 
                 model. Firstly, we review models and results relating to the 
                 movement, dispersal and population redistribution of animals 
                 and micro-organisms. This includes direct calculation of mean 
                 squared displacement, mean dispersal distance, tortuosity measures, 
                 as well as possible limitations of these model approaches. 
                 Secondly, oriented movement and chemotaxis models are reviewed. 
                 General hyperbolic models based on the linear transport equation 
                 are introduced and we show how a reinforced random walk can be 
                 used to model movement where the individual changes its environment. 
                 We discuss the applications of these models in the context of cell 
                 migration leading to blood vessel growth (angiogenesis). Finally, 
                 we discuss how the various random walk models and approaches are 
                 related and the connections that underpin many of the key processes 
                 involved.},

               We model the dynamics of self-organized robot aggregation inspired by a study on the aggregation of gregarious arthropods. In swarms of German cockroaches, aggregation into clusters emerges solely from local interactions between the individuals, whereas the probabilities of joining or leaving a cluster are a function of the cluster size. We propose a non-spatial population dynamics model that keeps track of the number of robots in clusters of specific size using control parameters of the individual robots and the probability of detecting another robot in the environment. The model is able to quantitatively and qualitatively predict the dynamics observed in extensive realistic multi-robot simulation, and provides qualitative agreement with data obtained from aggregation of Blattela germanica larvae. In particular, we show by analysis, numerical and realistic simulation that the emergence of a single aggregate requires a minimal communication range between individuals.

abstract="Traditionally, two alternative design approaches have been available to engineers: top-down and bottom-up. In the top-down approach, the design process starts with specifying the global system state and assuming that each component has global knowledge of the system, as in a centralized approach. The solution is then decentralized by replacing global knowledge with communication. In the bottom-up approach, on the other hand, the design starts with specifying requirements and capabilities of individual components, and the global behavior is said to emerge out of interactions among constituent components and between components and the environment. In this paper we present a comparative study of both approaches with particular emphasis on applications to multi-agent system engineering and robotics. We outline the generic characteristics of both approaches from the MAS perspective, and identify three elements that we believe should serve as criteria for how and when to apply either of the approaches. We demonstrate our analysis on a specific example of load balancing problem in robotics. We also show that under certain assumptions on the communication and the external environment, both bottom-up and top-down methodologies produce very similar solutions.",

  abstract="De Vries and Biesmeijer described in 1998 an individual-oriented model that simulates the collective foraging behaviour of a colony of honeybees. Here we report how this model has been expanded and show how, through self-organization, three colony-level phenomena can emerge: symmetry breaking, cross inhibition and the equal harvest-rate distribution. Symmetry breaking is the phenomenon that the numbers of foragers visiting two equally profitable food sources will diverge after some time. Cross inhibition is the phenomenon that, by increasing the profitability of one of two equal food sources, the number of foragers visiting the other source will decrease. In some circumstances, the bees foraging on two sources of different profitabilities will be distributed between these sources such that the two average energy harvest rates are equal. We will refer to this phenomenon as the equal harvest-rate distribution. For each of these three phenomena, we show what the necessary behavioural rules to be followed by the individual forager bees are, and what the necessary circumstances are (that is, what values the model parameters should take) in order for these phenomena to arise. It seems that patch size and forager group size largely determine when each of these phenomena will arise. Experimenting with two types of currency, net gain rate and net gain efficiency, revealed that only gain rate may result in an equal harvest-rate distribution of foragers visiting different food sources.",

  abstract = "In groups of animals only a small proportion of individuals may possess particular information, such as a migration route or the direction to a resource. Individuals may differ in preferred direction resulting in conflicts of interest and, therefore, consensus decisions may have to be made to prevent the group from splitting. Recent theoretical work has shown how leadership and consensus decision making can occur without active signalling or individual recognition. Here we test these predictions experimentally using humans. We found that a small informed minority could guide a group of naÃ¯ve individuals to a target without verbal communication or obvious signalling. Both the time to target and deviation from target were decreased by the presence of informed individuals. When conflicting directional information was given to different group members, the time taken to reach the target was not significantly increased; suggesting that consensus decision making in conflict situations is possible, and highly efficient. Where there was imbalance in the number of informed individuals with conflicting information, the majority dictated group direction. Our results also suggest that the spatial starting position of informed individuals influences group motion, which has implications in terms of crowd control and planning for evacuations. "

                 distributed systems maintain an optimal supply of
                 multiple nutrients essential for life and reproduction.
                 In the case of animals, the nutritional requirements of
                 the cells within the body are coordinated by the brain
                 in neural and chemical dialogue with sensory systems
                 and peripheral organs. At the level of an insect
                 society, the requirements for the entire colony are met
                 by the foraging efforts of a minority of workers
                 responding to cues emanating from the brood. Both
                 examples involve components specialized to deal with
                 nutrient supply and demand (brains and peripheral
                 organs, foragers and brood). However, some of the most
                 species-rich, largest, and ecologically significant
                 heterotrophic organisms on earth, such as the vast
                 mycelial networks of fungi, comprise distributed
                 #networks without specialized centers: How do these
                 organisms coordinate the search for multiple nutrients?
                 We address this question in the acellular slime mold
                 Physarum polycephalum and show that this extraordinary
                 organism can make complex nutritional decisions,
                 despite lacking a coordination center and comprising
                 only a single vast multinucleate cell. We show that a
                 single slime mold is able to grow to contact patches of
                 different nutrient quality in the precise proportions
                 necessary to compose an optimal diet. That such
                 organisms have the capacity to maintain the balance of
                 carbon- and nitrogen-based nutrients by selective
                 foraging has considerable implications not only for our
                 understanding of nutrient balancing in distributed
                 systems but for the functional ecology of soils,
                 nutrient cycling, and carbon sequestration.},

  abstract    = {Economic models of animal behaviour assume that
                 decision-makers are rational, meaning that they assess
                 options according to intrinsic fitness value and not
                 by comparison with available alternatives. This
                 expectation is frequently violated, but the
                 significance of irrational behaviour remains
                 controversial. One possibility is that irrationality
                 arises from cognitive constraints that necessitate
                 short cuts like comparative evaluation. If so, the
                 study of whether and when irrationality occurs can
                 illuminate cognitive mechanisms. We applied this logic
                 in a novel setting: the collective decisions of insect
                 societies. We tested for irrationality in colonies of
                 Temnothorax ants choosing between two nest sites that
                 varied in multiple attributes, such that neither site
                 was clearly superior. In similar situations, individual
                 animals show irrational changes in preference when a
                 third relatively unattractive option is introduced. In
                 contrast, we found no such effect in colonies. We
                 suggest that immunity to irrationality in this case may
                 result from the ants’ decentralized decision mechanism.
                 A colony's choice does not depend on site comparison by
                 individuals, but instead self-organizes from the
                 interactions of multiple ants, most of which are aware
                 of only a single site. This strategy may filter out
                 comparative effects, preventing systematic errors that
                 would otherwise arise from the cognitive limitations of
                 individuals.},

However, trade-offs between speed and cohesion, that is the degree to which a group remains together as a single entity, as a result of their decision making, have been comparatively neglected. We combine theory and experimentation to show that in decision-making systems, speed–cohesion trade-offs are a natural complement to speed–accuracy trade-offs and are therefore of general importance. We then analyse the decision performance of 32 rock ant, Temnothorax albipennis, colonies in experiments in which accuracy of collective decision making was held constant, but time urgency varied. These experiments reveal for the first time an adaptive speed–cohesion trade-off in collective decision making and how this is achieved. In accord with different time constraints, colonies can decide quickly, at the cost of social unity, or they can decide slowly with much greater cohesion. We discuss the similarity between cohesion and the term precision as used in statistics and engineering. This emphasizes the generality of speed versus cohesion/precision trade-offs in decision making and decision implementation in other fields within animal behaviour such as sexually selected motor displays and even certain aspects of birdsong. We also suggest that speed versus precision trade-offs may occur when individuals within a group need to synchronize their activity, and in collective navigation, cooperative hunting and in certain escape behaviours."

We designed a fully autonomous robot, and then created a swarm using ethanol as the trail pheromone allowing the robots to communicate with one another indirectly via pheromone trails. Our group recruitment and cooperative transport algorithms provide the robots with the required swarm behavior. We conducted both simulations and experiments with real robot swarms, and analyzed the data statistically to investigate any changes caused by pheromone communication in the performance of the swarm in solving foraging recruitment and cooperative transport tasks. The results show that the robots can communicate using pheromone trails, and that the improvement due to pheromone communication may be non-linear, depending on the size of the robot swarm.",

  abstract    = "An alternative model to the formation of pyramidal
                structures is presented in the framework of social
                systems. The population is assumed to be distributed
                between two social orientations G and H with respective
                probabilities p0 and (1 - p0). Instead of starting the
                hierarchy with a given H-orientation at the top and then
                going downwards in a deterministic way, the hierarchy is
                initiated randomly at the bottom from the surrounding
                population. Every level is then selected from the one
                underneath using the principle of majority rule. The
                hierarchy is thus self-oriented at the top. It is shown
                how such self-oriented hierarchies are always H-oriented
                provided they have a minimal number of levels which is
                determined by the value of p0. Their stability is
                studied against increases in p0. An ideal transition to
                G-self-oriented hierarchies is obtained."

It shows in particular that a huge majority can be self-eliminated while climbing up the hierarchy levels. This majority democratic self-elimination articulates around the existence of fixed points in the voting flow. An unstable fixed point determines the critical threshold to full and total power. It can be varied from 50% up to 77% of initial support. Our model could shed new light on the last century eastern European communist collapse.}

As for human transportation networks (roads, airlines, etc.), the design and the placement of the connecting points (or nodes) dramatically affects the movement of individuals and hence the exchanges of material and information. In a previous study, we have shown that the geometrical configuration of these nodes (i.e., the angles between the different exiting branches) can affect the route followed by an ant in a network of galleries and, as a consequence, the efficiency of the pheromone-based recruitment toward a food source. Here we show that we can reproduce these results using ant-like robots with minimal perceptual and cognitive capabilities. We demonstrate that the simple interaction between the displacement of an ant and the geometrical configuration of the gallery network can greatly affect the foraging performances of the colony. This result increases our understanding of how workers move through structures built by ant colonies and more generally points toward possible improvements for the design of man-made transportation networks.},

  abstract ={This paper presents a solution to the problem of self-organized aggregation of embodied robots that requires no arithmetic computation. The robots have no memory and are equipped with one binary sensor, which informs them whether or not there is another robot in their line of sight. It is proven that the sensor needs to have a sufficiently long range; otherwise aggregation cannot be guaranteed, irrespective of the controller used. The optimal controller is found by performing a grid search over the space of all possible controllers. With this controller, robots rotate on the spot when they perceive another robot, and move backwards along a circular trajectory otherwise. This controller is proven to always aggregate two simultaneously moving robots in finite time, an upper bound for which is provided. Simulations show that the controller also aggregates at least 1000 robots into a single cluster consistently. Moreover, in 30 experiments with 40 physical e-puck robots, 98.6% of the robots aggregated into one cluster. The results obtained have profound implications for the implementation of multi-robot systems at scales where conventional approaches to sensing and information processing are no longer applicable.},

                  system of equations permitting analytical investigation. We find
                  that the model reproduces several characteristic features of swarms,
                  including spontaneous symmetry breaking, noise- and density-driven
                  order–disorder transitions that can be of first or second order,
                  and intermittency. Reproducing these experimental observations using
                  a non-spatial model suggests that spatial geometry may have less of
                  an impact on collective motion than previously t

                  in dynamic natural environments where they possess
                  little or no knowledge of where resources are located. 
                  Foraging theory predicts that in environments with
                  sparsely distributed target resources, where forager
                  knowledge about resources’ locations is incomplete,
                  Lévy flight movements optimize the success of random
                  searches. However, the putative success of Lévy
                  foraging has been demonstrated only in model
                  simulations. Here, we use high-temporal-resolution
                  Global Positioning System (GPS) tracking of wandering
                  (Diomedea exulans) and black-browed albatrosses
                  (Thalassarche melanophrys) with simultaneous recording
                  of prey captures, to show that both species exhibit
                  Lévy and Brownian movement patterns. We find that
                  total prey masses captured by wandering albatrosses
                  during Lévy movements exceed daily energy requirements
                  by nearly fourfold, and approached yields by Brownian
                  movements in other habitats. These results, together
                  with our reanalysis of previously published albatross
                  data, overturn the notion that albatrosses do not
                  exhibit Lévy patterns during foraging, and demonstrate
                  that Lévy flights of predators in dynamic natural
                  environments present a beneficial alternative strategy
                  to simple, spatially intensive behaviors. Our findings
                  add support to the possibility that biological Lévy
                  flight may have naturally evolved as a search strategy
                  in response to sparse resources and scant
                  information.},

  abstract = {Aggregation is widespread in invertebrate societies and can appear in response to environmental heterogeneities or by attraction between individuals. We performed experiments with cockroach, Blattella germanica, larvae in a homogeneous environment to investigate the influence of interactions between individuals on aggregations. Different densities were tested. A first phase led to radial dispersion of larvae in relation to wall-following behaviours; the consequence of this process was a homogeneous distribution of larvae around the periphery of the arena. A second phase corresponded to angular reorganization of larvae leading to the formation of aggregates. The phenomenon was analysed both at the individual and collective levels. Individual cockroaches modulated their behaviour depending on the presence of other larvae in their vicinity: probabilities of stopping and resting times were both higher when the numbers of larvae were greater. We then developed an agent-based model implementing individual behavioural rules, all derived from experiments, to explain the aggregation dynamics at the collective level. This study supports evidence that aggregation relies on mechanisms of amplification, supported by interactions between individuals that follow simple rules based on local information and without knowledge of the global structure.}

Here, we examine SATs in the foraging decisions of an acellular, amoeboid organism: the slime mould Physarum polycephalum. Slime moulds were given a simple discrimination task: selecting the highest-quality food item from a set of three options. We investigated the effect of two stressors, light exposure and hunger, on the speed and accuracy of decision-making. We also examined the effect of task difficulty. When given a difficult discrimination task, stressed individuals tend to make faster decisions than non-stressed individuals. This effect was reversed in plasmodia given easy discrimination tasks, where stressed individuals made slower decisions than non-stressed individuals. We found evidence of SATs, such that individuals who made fast decisions were more likely to make costly errors by selecting the worst possible food option. Our results suggest that SATs occur in a wider range of taxa than previously considered.},

	abstract = {Most models of animal foraging and consumer choice assume that individuals make choices based on the absolute value of items and are therefore {\textquoteleft}economically rational{\textquoteright}. However, frequent violations of rationality by animals, including humans, suggest that animals use comparative valuation rules. Are comparative valuation strategies a consequence of the way brains process information, or are they an intrinsic feature of biological decision-making? Here, we examine the principles of rationality in an organism with radically different information-processing mechanisms: the brainless, unicellular, slime mould Physarum polycephalum. We offered P. polycephalum amoebas a choice between food options that varied in food quality and light exposure (P. polycephalum is photophobic). The use of an absolute valuation rule will lead to two properties: transitivity and independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA). Transitivity is satisfied if preferences have a consistent, linear ordering, while IIA states that a decision maker{\textquoteright}s preference for an item should not change if the choice set is expanded. A violation of either of these principles suggests the use of comparative rather than absolute valuation rules. Physarum polycephalum satisfied transitivity by having linear preference rankings. However, P. polycephalum{\textquoteright}s preference for a focal alternative increased when a third, inferior quality option was added to the choice set, thus violating IIA and suggesting the use of a comparative valuation process. The discovery of comparative valuation rules in a unicellular organism suggests that comparative valuation rules are ubiquitous, if not universal, among biological decision makers.},

  abstract    = {The problem of how to compromise between speed and accuracy in 
                 decision-making faces organisms at many levels of biological 
                 complexity. Striking parallels are evident between decision-making 
                 in primate brains and collective decision-making in social insect 
                 colonies: in both systems, separate populations accumulate evidence 
                 for alternative choices; when one population reaches a threshold, a 
                 decision is made for the corresponding alternative, and this threshold 
                 may be varied to compromise between the speed and the accuracy of 
                 decision-making. In primate decision-making, simple models of these 
                 processes have been shown, under certain parametrizations, to implement the
                 statistically optimal procedure that minimizes decision time for any
                 given error rate. In this paper, we adapt these same analysis techniques
                 and apply them to new models of collective decision-making in social 
                 insect colonies. We show that social insect colonies may also be able to achieve
                 statistically optimal collective decision-making in a very similar way to primate
                 brains, via direct competition between evidence-accumulating populations. This
                 optimality result makes testable predictions for how collective decision-making in
                 social insects should be organized. Our approach also represents the first
                 attempt to identify a common theoretical framework for the study of
                 decision-making in diverse biological systems.},

@book{nolfi|floreano:2000,
  abstract    = {Evolutionary robotics is a new technique for the
                 automatic creation of autonomous robots. Inspired by the
                 Darwinian principle of selective reproduction of the
                 fittest, it views robots as autonomous artificial
                 organisms that develop their own skills in close
                 interaction with the environment and without human
                 intervention. Drawing heavily on biology and ethology, it
                 uses the tools of neural networks, genetic algorithms,
                 dynamic systems, and biomorphic engineering. The
                 resulting robots share with simple biological systems the
                 characteristics of robustness, simplicity, small size,
                 flexibility, and modularity. In evolutionary robotics, an
                 initial population of artificial chromosomes, each
                 encoding the control system of a robot, is randomly
                 created and put into the environment. Each robot is then
                 free to act (move, look around, manipulate) according to
                 its genetically specified controller while its
                 performance on various tasks is automatically evaluated.
                 The fittest robots then "reproduce" by swapping parts of
                 their genetic material with small random mutations. The
                 process is repeated until the "birth" of a robot that
                 satisfies the performance criteria. This book describes
                 the basic concepts and methodologies of evolutionary
                 robotics and the results achieved so far. An important
                 feature is the clear presentation of a set of empirical
                 experiments of increasing complexity. Software with a
                 graphic interface, freely available on a Web page, will
                 allow the reader to replicate and vary (in simulation and
                 on real robots) most of the experiments.},

    abstract  = {{Cooperation is needed for evolution to
                  construct new levels of organization.
                  Genomes, cells, multicellular
                  organisms, social insects, and human
                  society are all based on cooperation.
                  Cooperation means that selfish
                  replicators forgo some of their
                  reproductive potential to help one another.
                  But natural selection implies
                  competition and therefore opposes
                  cooperation unless a specific mechanism
                  is at work. Here I discuss five
                  mechanisms for the evolution of
                  cooperation: kin selection, direct
                  reciprocity, indirect reciprocity,
                  network reciprocity, and group selection.

    abstract = {<p>We present a dynamical systems analysis of a decision-making mechanism inspired by collective choice in house-hunting honeybee swarms, revealing the crucial role of cross-inhibitory ?stop-signalling? in improving the decision-making capabilities. We show that strength of cross-inhibition is a decision-parameter influencing how decisions depend both on the difference in value and on the mean value of the alternatives; this is in contrast to many previous mechanistic models of decision-making, which are typically sensitive to decision accuracy rather than the value of the option chosen. The strength of cross-inhibition determines when deadlock over similarly valued alternatives is maintained or broken, as a function of the mean value; thus, changes in cross-inhibition strength allow adaptive time-dependent decision-making strategies. Cross-inhibition also tunes the minimum difference between alternatives required for reliable discrimination, in a manner similar to Weber's law of just-noticeable difference. Finally, cross-inhibition tunes the speed-accuracy trade-off realised when differences in the values of the alternatives are sufficiently large to matter. We propose that the model, and the significant role of the values of the alternatives, may describe other decision-making systems, including intracellular regulatory circuits, and simple neural circuits, and may provide guidance in the design of decision-making algorithms for artificial systems, particularly those functioning without centralised control.</p>},

              probabilistic modeling methodology motivated by an
              inspection task performed by a group of miniature robots.
              Our models explicitly consider spatiality and yield
              accurate predictions on system performance. An agent’s
              spatial distribution over time is modeled by the Fokker–
              lanck diffusion model and complements current non-spatial
              microscopic and macroscopic models that model the discrete
              state distribution of a distributed robotic system. We
              validate our models on a microscopic level based on sub-
              icroscopic, embodied robot simulations as well as real
              robot experiments. Subsequently, using the validated
              microscopic models as our template, abstraction is raised
              to the level of macroscopic difference equations. We
              discuss the dependency of the modeling performance on the
              distance from the robot origin (drop-off location) and
              temporal convergence of the team distribution. Also, using
              an asymmetric setup, we show the necessity of spatial
              modeling methodologies for environments where the robotic
              platform underlies drift phenomena.},

    abstract = {<p>The engineering of large-scale decentralised systems requires sound methodologies to guarantee the attainment of the desired macroscopic system-level behaviour given the microscopic individual-level implementation. While a general-purpose methodology is currently out of reach, specific solutions can be given to broad classes of problems by means of well-conceived <italic>design patterns</italic>. We propose a design pattern for collective decision making grounded on experimental/theoretical studies of the nest-site selection behaviour observed in honeybee swarms (<italic>Apis mellifera</italic>). The way in which honeybee swarms arrive at consensus is fairly well-understood at the macroscopic level. We provide formal guidelines for the microscopic implementation of collective decisions to quantitatively match the macroscopic predictions. We discuss implementation strategies based on both homogeneous and heterogeneous multiagent systems, and we provide means to deal with spatial and topological factors that have a bearing on the micro-macro link. Finally, we exploit the design pattern in two case studies that showcase the viability of the approach. Besides engineering, such a design pattern can prove useful for a deeper understanding of decision making in natural systems thanks to the inclusion of individual heterogeneities and spatial factors, which are often disregarded in theoretical modelling.</p>},

                 programmable self-assembly of complex two-dimensional
                 shapes with a thousand-robot swarm. This was enabled by
                 creating autonomous robots designed to operate in large

                 by developing a collective algorithm for shape

                 error characteristic of large-scale decentralized

                 problem of finding a good site to establish a new
                 colony. We examined the potential effects of swarm
                 size on the quality of nest-site choice through a
                 combination of modelling and field experiments. We
                 used an individual-based model to examine the effects
                 of swarm size on decision accuracy under the assumption
                 that the number of bees actively involved in the
                 decision-making process (scouts) is an increasing
                 function of swarm size. We found that the ability of
                 a swarm to choose the best of two nest sites decreases
                 as swarm size increases when there is some time-lag
                 between discovering the sites, consistent with 
                 Janson & Beekman (Janson & Beekman 2007 Proceedings of
                 European Conference on Complex Systems, pp. 204–211.).
                 However, when simulated swarms were faced with a
                 realistic problem of choosing between many nest sites
                 discoverable at all times, larger swarms were more
                 accurate in their decisions than smaller swarms owing
                 to their ability to discover nest sites more rapidly.
                 Our experimental fieldwork showed that large swarms
                 invest a larger number of scouts into the 
                 decision-making process than smaller swarms.
                 Preliminary analysis of waggle dances from experimental
                 swarms also suggested that large swarms could indeed
                 discover and advertise nest sites at a faster rate
                 than small swarms.},

  abstract    = {Honeybees make decisions collectively--and democratically. 
                 Every year, faced with the life-or-death problem of
                 choosing and traveling to a new home, honeybees stake
                 everything on a process that includes collective
                 fact-finding, vigorous debate, and consensus building.
                 In fact, as world-renowned animal behaviorist Thomas Seeley
                 reveals, these incredible insects have much to teach us when
                 it comes to collective wisdom and effective decision making.
                 A remarkable and richly illustrated account of scientific
                 discovery, Honeybee Democracy brings together, for the first
                 time, decades of Seeley's pioneering research to tell the
                 amazing story of house hunting and democratic debate among
                 the honeybees.In the late spring and early summer, as a bee
                 colony becomes overcrowded, a third of the hive stays behind
                 and rears a new queen, while a swarm of thousands departs with
                 the old queen to produce a daughter colony. Seeley describes
                 how these bees evaluate potential nest sites, advertise their
                 discoveries to one another, engage in open deliberation,
                 choose a final site, and navigate together--as a swirling
                 cloud of bees--to their new home. Seeley investigates how
                 evolution has honed the decision-making methods of honeybees
                 over millions of years, and he considers similarities between
                 the ways that bee swarms and primate brains process information.
                 He concludes that what works well for bees can also work well
                 for people: any decision-making group should consist of
                 individuals with shared interests and mutual respect, a
                 leader's influence should be minimized, debate should be
                 relied upon, diverse solutions should be sought, and the
                 majority should be counted on for a dependable resolution.
                 An impressive exploration of animal behavior, Honeybee
                 Democracy shows that decision-making groups, whether honeybee
                 or human, can be smarter than even the smartest individuals
                 in them.},

We present a stochastic control algorithm based on two biological mechanismsâstigmergy and templatesâthat takes advantage of compliant pockets for autonomous construction with single and multiple robots. The control algorithm guides the robot(s) to build the protective barrier without relying on a central planner, an external computer, or a motion capture system. We propose a statistical model to represent the structures built with the compliant pockets, and we provide a set of criteria for assessing the performance of the proposed system. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed system, real-robot and simulation experiments were carried out. The results show the viability of the proposed autonomous construction system.}

  abstract    = {Animal groups are said to make consensus decisions when group
                 members come to agree on the same option. Consensus decisions
                 are taxonomically widespread and potentially offer three key
                 benefits: maintenance of group cohesion, enhancement of decision
                 accuracy compared with lone individuals and improvement in
                 decision speed. In the absence of centralized control, arriving
                 at a consensus depends on local interactions in which each
                 individual's likelihood of choosing an option increases with
                 the number of others already committed to that option. The
                 resulting positive feedback can effectively direct most or all
                 group members to the best available choice. In this paper, we
                 examine the functional form of the individual response to others'
                 behaviour that lies at the heart of this process. We review
                 recent theoretical and empirical work on consensus decisions,
                 and we develop a simple mathematical model to show the central
                 importance to speedy and accurate decisions of quorum responses,
                 in which an animal's probability of exhibiting a behaviour is
                 a sharply nonlinear function of the number of other individuals 
                 already performing this behaviour. We argue that systems relying 
                 on such quorum rules can achieve cohesive choice of the best option 
                 while also permitting adaptive tuning of the trade-off between

  abstract = {Summary Decisions reached through consensus are often more accurate, because they efficiently utilize the diverse information possessed by group members [1â3]. A trust in consensus decision making underlies many of our democratic political and judicial institutions [4], as well as the design of web tools such as Google, Wikipedia, and prediction markets [5, 6]. In theory, consensus for the option favored by the majority of group members will lead to improved decision-making accuracy as group size increases [2, 4]. Although group-living animals are known to utilize social information [7â10], little is known about whether or not decision accuracy increases with group size. In order to reach consensus, group members must be able to integrate the disparate information they possess. Positive feedback, resulting from copying others, can spread information quickly through the group, but it can also result in all individuals making the same, possibly incorrect, choice [8, 11, 12]. On the other hand, if individuals never copy each other, their decision making remains independent and they fail to benefit from information exchange [4]. Here, we show how small groups of sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) reach consensus when choosing which of two replica fish to follow. As group size increases, the fish make more accurate decisions, becoming better at discriminating subtle phenotypic differences of the replicas. A simple quorum rule proves sufficient to explain our observations, suggesting that animals can make accurate decisions without the need for complicated comparison of the information they possess. Furthermore, although submission to peers can lead to occasional cascades of incorrect decisions, these can be explained as a byproduct of what is usually accurate consensus decision making.}

  abstract    = {Gene expression is a stochastic, or “noisy,” process. This noise comes about 
                 in two ways. The inherent stochasticity of biochemical processes such as transcription
                 and translation generates “intrinsic” noise. In addition, fluctuations in the amounts
                 or states of other cellular components lead indirectly to variation in the expression
                 of a particular gene and thus represent “extrinsic” noise. Here, we show how the total
                 variation in the level of expression of a given gene can be decomposed into its
                 intrinsic and extrinsic components. We demonstrate theoretically that simultaneous
                 measurement of two identical genes per cell enables discrimination of these two types of
                 noise. Analytic expressions for intrinsic noise are given for a model that involves all the major steps in transcription and translation. These expressions give the sensitivity to various parameters, quantify the deviation from Poisson statistics, and provide a way of fitting experiment. Transcription dominates the intrinsic noise when the average number of proteins made per mRNA transcript is greater than ≃2. Below this number, translational effects also become important. Gene replication and cell division, included in the model, cause protein numbers to tend to a limit cycle. We calculate a general form for the extrinsic noise and illustrate it with the particular case of a single fluctuating extrinsic variable—a repressor protein, which acts on the gene of interest. All results are confirmed by stochastic simulation using plausible parameters for Escherichia coli.},

  abstract="We introduce a framework, called ``physicomimetics,'' that provides distributed control of large collections of mobile physical agents in sensor networks. The agents sense and react to virtual forces, which are motivated by natural physics laws. Thus, physicomimetics is founded upon solid scientific principles. Furthermore, this framework provides an effective basis for self-organization, fault-tolerance, and self-repair. Three primary factors distinguish our framework from others that are related: an emphasis on minimality (e.g., cost effectiveness of large numbers of agents implies a need for expendable platforms with few sensors), ease of implementation, and run-time efficiency. Examples are shown of how this framework has been applied to construct various regular geometric lattice configurations (distributed sensing grids), as well as dynamic behavior for perimeter defense and surveillance. Analyses are provided that facilitate system understanding and predictability, including both qualitative and quantitative analyses of potential energy and a system phase transition. Physicomimetics has been implemented both in simulation and on a team of seven mobile robots. Specifics of the robotic embodiment are presented in the paper.",

  abstract    = {A model of division of labour in insect societies, based on 
                 variable response thresholds is introduced. Response thresholds 
                 refer to the likelihood of reacting to task{\textendash}associated 
                 stimuli. Low{\textendash}threshold individuals perform tasks at a 
                 lower level of stimulus than high{\textendash}threshold individuals. 
                 Within individual workers, performing a given task induces a decrease
                 in the corresponding threshold, and not performing the task induces
                 an increase in the threshold. This combined reinforcement process leads
                 to the emergence of specialized workers, i.e. workers that are more
                 responsive to stimuli associated with particular task requirements, 
                 from a group of initially identical individuals. Predictions of the 
                 dynamics of task specialization resulting from this model are presented. 
                 Predictions are also made as to what should be observed when specialists 
                 of a given task are removed from the colony and reintroduced after a 
                 varying amount of time: the colony does not recover the same state as 
                 that prior to the perturbation, and the difference between before and 
                 after the perturbation is more strongly marked as the time between 
                 separation and reintroduction increases.},

  abstract="In social insects, both self-organisation and communication play a crucial role for the accomplishment of many tasks at a collective level. Communication is performed with different modalities, which can be roughly classified into three classes: indirect (stigmergic) communication, direct interactions and direct communication. The use of stigmergic communication is predominant in social insects (e.g. the pheromone trails in ants), where, however, direct interactions (e.g. antennation in ants) and direct communication (e.g. the waggle dance in honey bees) can also be observed. Taking inspiration from insect societies, we present an experimental study of self-organising behaviours for a group of robots, which exploit communication to coordinate their activities. In particular, the robots are placed in an arena presenting holes and open borders, which they should avoid while moving coordinately. Artificial evolution is responsible for the synthesis in a simulated environment of the robot's neural controllers, which are subsequently tested on physical robots. We study different communication strategies among the robots: no direct communication, handcrafted signalling and a completely evolved approach. We show that the latter is the most efficient, suggesting that artificial evolution can produce behaviours that are more adaptive than those obtained with conventional design methodologies. Moreover, we show that the evolved controllers produce a self-organising system that is robust enough to be tested on physical robots, notwithstanding the huge gap between simulation and reality.",

abstract = "We review the observations and the basic laws describing the essential aspects of collective motion — being one of the most common and spectacular manifestation of coordinated behavior. Our aim is to provide a balanced discussion of the various facets of this highly multidisciplinary field, including experiments, mathematical methods and models for simulations, so that readers with a variety of background could get both the basics and a broader, more detailed picture of the field. The observations we report on include systems consisting of units ranging from macromolecules through metallic rods and robots to groups of animals and people. Some emphasis is put on models that are simple and realistic enough to reproduce the numerous related observations and are useful for developing concepts for a better understanding of the complexity of systems consisting of many simultaneously moving entities. As such, these models allow the establishing of a few fundamental principles of flocking. In particular, it is demonstrated, that in spite of considerable differences, a number of deep analogies exist between equilibrium statistical physics systems and those made of self-propelled (in most cases living) units. In both cases only a few well defined macroscopic/collective states occur and the transitions between these states follow a similar scenario, involving discontinuity and algebraic divergences. "

  abstract ={Despite the growing interest in collective phenomena such as “swarm intelligence” and “wisdom of the crowds,” little is known about the mechanisms underlying decision-making in vertebrate animal groups. How do animals use the behavior of others to make more accurate decisions, especially when it is not possible to identify which individuals possess pertinent information? One plausible answer is that individuals respond only when they see a threshold number of individuals perform a particular behavior. Here, we investigate the role of such “quorum responses” in the movement decisions of fish (three-spine stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus). We show that a quorum response to conspecifics can explain how sticklebacks make collective movement decisions, both in the absence and presence of a potential predation risk. Importantly our experimental work shows that a quorum response can reduce the likelihood of amplification of nonadaptive following behavior. Whereas the traveling direction of solitary fish was strongly influenced by a single replica conspecific, the replica was largely ignored by larger groups of four or eight sticklebacks under risk, and the addition of a second replica was required to exert influence on the movement decisions of such groups. Model simulations further predict that quorum responses by fish improve the accuracy and speed of their decision-making over that of independent decision-makers or those using a weak linear response. This study shows that effective and accurate information transfer in groups may be gained only through nonlinear responses of group members to each other, thus highlighting the importance of quorum decision-making.},

  abstract ={Among the most striking aspects of the movement of many animal groups are their sudden coherent changes in direction. Recent observations of locusts and starlings have shown that this directional switching is an intrinsic property of their motion. Similar direction switches are seen in self-propelled particle and other models of group motion. Comprehending the factors that determine such switches is key to understanding the movement of these groups. Here, we adopt a coarse-grained approach to the study of directional switching in a self-propelled particle model assuming an underlying one-dimensional Fokker–Planck equation for the mean velocity of the particles. We continue with this assumption in analyzing experimental data on locusts and use a similar systematic Fokker–Planck equation coefficient estimation approach to extract the relevant information for the assumed Fokker–Planck equation underlying that experimental data. In the experiment itself the motion of groups of 5 to 100 locust nymphs was investigated in a homogeneous laboratory environment, helping us to establish the intrinsic dynamics of locust marching bands. We determine the mean time between direction switches as a function of group density for the experimental data and the self-propelled particle model. This systematic approach allows us to identify key differences between the experimental data and the model, revealing that individual locusts appear to increase the randomness of their movements in response to a loss of alignment by the group. We give a quantitative description of how locusts use noise to maintain swarm alignment. We discuss further how properties of individual animal behavior, inferred by using the Fokker–Planck equation coefficient estimation approach, can be implemented in the self-propelled particle model to replicate qualitatively the group level dynamics seen in the experimental data.},

abstract = {The process by which new ideas, innovations, and behaviors spread through a large social network can be thought of as a networked interaction game: Each agent obtains information from certain number of agents in his friendship neighborhood, and adapts his idea or behavior to increase his benefit. In this paper, we are interested in how opinions, about a certain topic, form in social networks. We model opinions as continuous scalars ranging from 0 to 1 with 1 (0) representing extremely positive (negative) opinion. Each agent has an initial opinion and incurs some cost depending on the opinions of his neighbors, his initial opinion, and his stubbornness about his initial opinion. Agents iteratively update their opinions based on their own initial opinions and observing the opinions of their neighbors. The iterative update of an agent can be viewed as a myopic cost-minimization response (i.e., the so-called best response) to the others' actions. We study whether an equilibrium can emerge as a result of such local interactions and how such equilibrium possibly depends on the network structure, initial opinions of the agents, and the location of stubborn agents and the extent of their stubbornness. We also study the convergence speed to such equilibrium and characterize the convergence time as a function of aforementioned factors. We also discuss the implications of such results in a few well-known graphs such as Erdos-Renyi random graphs and small-world graphs.},

abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the impact of random interactions between agents in a social network on the diffusion of opinions in the network. Opinion of each agent is assumed to be a binary variable and each agent is assumed to be able to interact with any other agent in the network. This models scenarios where every agent in the network has to choose from two available options and the size of the neighborhood of each agent is an increasing function of the total number agents in the network. It is assumed that each agent updates its opinion at random instants upon interacting with other randomly sampled agents. We consider two simple rules of interaction: (1) the voter rule in which the updating agent simply copies the opinion of another randomly sampled agent; (2) the majority rule, in which the updating agent samples multiple agents and adopts the majority opinion among the sampled agents and the agent itself. Under each rule, we consider two different scenarios which have not been considered in the literature thus far: (1) where the agents are 'biased' towards one of the opinions, (2) where different agents have different degrees of stubbornness. We show that the presence of biased agents reduces the consensus time for the voter rule exponentially as compared to the case where the agents are unbiased. For the majority rule model with biased agents, we show that the network reaches consensus on a particular opinion with high probability only when the initial fraction of agents having that opinion is above a certain threshold. For the majority rule model with stubborn agents, we observe metastability where the network switches back and forth between stable states spending long intervals in each state.},

abstract = {We study the effect of inflexible agents on two state opinion dynamics. The model operates via repeated local updates of random grouping of agents. While floater agents do eventually flip their opinion to follow the local majority, inflexible agents keep their opinion always unchanged. It is a quenched individual opinion. In the bare model (no inflexibles), a separator at 50 {\%} drives the dynamics towards either one of two pure attractors, each associated with a full polarization along one of the opinions. The initial majority wins. The existence of inflexibles for only one of the two opinions is found to shift the separator at a lower value than 50 {\%} in favor of that side. Moreover it creates an incompressible minority around the inflexibles, one of the pure attractors becoming a mixed phase attractor. In addition above a threshold of 17 {\%} inflexibles make their side sure of winning whatever the initial conditions are. The inflexible minority wins. An equal presence of inflexibles on both sides restores the balanced dynamics with again a separator at 50 {\%} and now two mixed phase attractors on each side. Nevertheless, beyond 25 {\%} the dynamics is reversed with a unique attractor at a 50-50 stable equilibrium. But a very small advantage in inflexibles results in a decisive lowering of the separator at the advantage of the corresponding opinion. A few percent advantage does guarantee to become majority with one single attractor. The model is solved exhaustedly for groups of size 3. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

We show that when opinions spread in a population where a fraction of individuals (zealots) unshakably maintain their view, one of four qualitatively distinct kinds of collective dynamics arises, depending on the specific rules governing the social interactions. Unsurprisingly, when their density is high, zealots drive the whole population to consensus on their opinion. For low densities a rich phase diagram emerges: a finite population of dissenters can survive and be the only stationary state or may need a critical initial mass of dissenters to be sustained; the critical mass may vanish or not as the density is reduced; the transition to the high density regime can be smooth or abrupt, and shows interesting hysteretic effects. For each choice of the interaction rules we calculate the critical density of zealots above which diverse opinions cannot survive.},

abstract = {In many political elections, the electorate appears to be a composite of partisan and independent voters. Given that partisans are not likely to convert to a different party, an important goal for a political party could be to mobilize independent voters toward the party with the help of strong leadership, mass media, partisans, and the effects of peer-to-peer influence. Based on the exact solution of classical voter model dynamics in the presence of perfectly partisan voters (i.e., zealots), we propose a computational method that uses pinning control strategy to maximize the share of a party in a social network of independent voters. The party, corresponding to the controller or zealots, optimizes the nodes to be controlled given the information about the connectivity of independent voters and the set of nodes that the opposing party controls.Weshow that controlling hubs is generally a good strategy, but the optimized strategy is even better. The superiority of the optimized strategy is particularly eminent when the independent voters are connected as directed (rather than undirected) networks.},

Specifically, we show that when the committed fraction grows beyond a critical value pc≈10{\%}, there is a dramatic decrease in the time T c taken for the entire population to adopt the committed opinion. In particular, for complete graphs we show that when p{\textless}pc, T c∼exp[$\alpha$(p)N], whereas for p{\textgreater}pc, T c∼lnN. We conclude with simulation results for Erdos-R{\'{e}}nyi random graphs and scale-free networks which show qualitatively similar behavior. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Physical Society.},

abstract = {The role of committed minorities in shaping public opinion has been recently addressed with the help of multiagent models. However, previous studies focused on homogeneous populations where zealots stand out only for their stubbornness. Here we consider the more general case in which individuals are characterized by different propensities to communicate. In particular, we correlate commitment with a higher tendency to push an opinion, acknowledging the fact that individuals with unwavering dedication to a cause are also more active in their attempts to promote their message. We show that these activists are not only more efficient in spreading their message but that their efforts require an order of magnitude fewer individuals than a randomly selected committed minority to bring the population over to a new consensus. Finally, we address the role of communities, showing that partisan divisions in the society can make it harder for committed individuals to flip the status-quo social consensus.},

abstract = {Group aggression influences communication and defense strategies in many social insect communities. Such aggression plays a particularly significant role in the lives of stingless bees, important native Neotropical pollinators, in which the battle for food resources can be deadly and critical to colony survival. However, the effects of group size on individual aggression levels and the spatio-temporal aggression strategy of communal aggressors have not been fully explored. We therefore investigated how group size affects the aggression levels and the spatio-temporal attack strategy (which body parts, and the amount of time spent in attacking each part) in close combats between Trigona spinipes foragers and a natural competitor, Melipona rufiventris. In all trials, T. spinipes foragers competitively excluded M. rufiventris foragers from nearby feeders, exhibiting four levels of aggressive behavior ranging from threat displays to prolonged grappling and decapitation. Surprisingly, aggression levels and spatial strategy corresponded to the size of group attacks. Larger groups of attackers used individually lower aggression levels than small groups of attackers. Smaller groups also attacked appendages linked to escape (legs and wings) with greater frequency than larger groups, which focused on vital central body areas (abdomen, thorax, and head). Increased aggression corresponded to increased risks for attackers and the attacked. All combatants engaging at the highest level of aggression died (100{\%} mortality). Thus the dominance style of T. spinipes may minimize attack risk and maximize victim harm with finely tuned hostility. {\textcopyright} Birkh{\"{a}}user Verlag, 2005.},

@article{Gastauer2011,
abstract = {For their nest defense, stingless bees (Meliponini) collect plant resins which they stick on intruders like ants or cleptobiotic robber bees causing their immobilization. The aim of this article is to identify all parts of stingless bee workers contacting these sticky resins. Of special interest are those body parts with anti-adhesive properties to resin, where it can be removed without residues. For that, extensive behavioral observations during foraging flight, handling and application of the resin have been carried out. When handling the resin, all tarsi touch the resin while walking above it. For transportation from plants to the nest during foraging flight, the resin is packed to the corbicula via tarsi and basitarsi of front and middle legs. Once stuck to the resin or after the corbicula had been unloaded, the bee's legs have to be cleaned thoroughly. Only the tips of the mandibles, that form, cut and apply the sticky resin, seem to have at least temporarily resin-rejecting properties.},

@article{Razali2014,
abstract = {Certain tasks require multiple robots to cooperate in order to solve them. The main problem with multi-robot systems is that they are inherently complex and usually situated in a dynamic environment. Now, biological immune systems possess a natural distributed control and exhibit real-time adaptivity, properties that are required to solve problems in multi-robot systems. In this thesis, biological immune systems and their response to external elements to maintain an organism's health state are researched. The objective of this research is to propose immune-inspired approaches to cooperation, to establish an adaptive cooperation algorithm, and to determine the refinements that can be applied in relation to cooperation. Two immune-inspired models that are based on the immune network theory are proposed, namely the Immune Network T-cell-regulated---with Memory (INT-M) and the Immune Network T-cell-regulated---Cross-Reactive (INT-X) models. The INT-M model is further studied where the results have suggested that the model is feasible and suitable to be used, especially in the multi-robot cooperative shepherding domain. The Collecting task in the RoboShepherd scenario and the application of the INT-M algorithm for multi-robot cooperation are discussed. This scenario provides a highly dynamic and complex situation that has wide applicability in real-world problems. The underlying 'mechanism of cooperation' in the immune inspired model (INT-M) is verified to be adaptive in this chosen scenario. Several multi-robot cooperative shepherding factors are studied and refinements proposed, notably methods used for Shepherds' Approach, Shepherds' Formation and Steering Points' Distance. This study also recognises the importance of flock identification in relation to cooperative shepherding, and the Connected Components Labelling method to overcome the related problem is presented. Further work is suggested on the proposed INT-X model that was not implemented in this study, since it builds on top of the INT-M algorithm and its refinements. This study can also be extended to include other shepherding behaviours, further investigation of other useful features of biological immune systems, and the application of the proposed models to other cooperative tasks.},

@article{Nouvian2016,
abstract = {Honeybees (Apis mellifera) are insects living in colonies with a complex social organization. Their nest contains food stores in the form of honey and pollen, as well as the brood, the queen and the bees themselves. These resources have to be defended against a wide range of predators and parasites, a task that is performed by specialized workers, called guard bees. Guards tune their response to both the nature of the threat and the environmental conditions, in order to achieve an efficient trade-off between defence and loss of foraging workforce. By releasing alarm pheromones, they are able to recruit other bees to help them handle large predators. These chemicals trigger both rapid and longer-term changes in the behaviour of nearby bees, thus priming them for defence. Here, we review our current understanding on how this sequence of events is performed and regulated depending on a variety of factors that are both extrinsic and intrinsic to the colony. We present our current knowledge on the neural bases of honeybee aggression and highlight research avenues for future studies in this area. We present a brief overview of the techniques used to study honeybee aggression, and discuss how these could be used to gain further insights into the mechanisms of this behaviour.},
